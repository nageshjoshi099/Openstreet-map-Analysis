The area under analysis is the Mumbai city area in India 

The link for the OSM XML file for Mumbai area: https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/mumbai_india/

I chose the Mumbai city area since it is my home city. The dataset cover not just the Mumbai city area but cover 
a wide chunk of the suburban areas to the north (Vasai area) and to the west (Navi Mumbai, Thane and other costal areas).
The link provided shows a rectangle covering the off coastal area as well. The dataset is highly human generated, something
which the analysis also shows, this is one of the prime reasons for the poor quality of the data. An attempt has been made to
clean the data well before any analysis is performed on it.
